You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with

Linking stunnel statically or dynamically with other modules is making
a combined work based on stunnel. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of stunnel gives you
permission to combine stunnel with free software programs or libraries that
are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release
of OpenSSL under the OpenSSL License (or modified versions of such code, with
unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the
terms of the GNU GPL for stunnel and the licenses of the other code concerned.

Note that people who make modified versions of stunnel are not obligated to
grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice
whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release
a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it
possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.


I'm not familiar with license. If I can't use these two in this way, please let
me know :)
